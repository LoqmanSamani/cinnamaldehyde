## Mechanism of the synthesis of Cinnamaldehyde from Benzaldehyde and acetic acid anhydride

### Perkin reaction

Perkin’s reaction mechanism includes the reaction between **aromatic aldehydes**, the **aliphatic acid anhydride**, 
and the **alkali salt** of the acid to give **cinnamic acid** derivatives.

(the Perkin reaction, which involves the use of an inorganic acetate salt in acetic anhydride to convert a variety of aromatic aldehydes into their corresponding 3-phenylprop-2-enoic acids.)

#### Perkin reaction mechanism 1

The reaction is initiated by heating the aldehyde with an excess of acid anhydride to 180°C. Typically, the reaction’s conditions lead to dehydration, which produces an anhydride. Unsaturated acid is produced by hydrolyzing the anhydride with diluted HCl after excess aldehyde has been removed by distillation under steam.

The reaction mechanism of the Perkin reaction can be explained as follows:

1) The carboxylate ion abstracts a proton to generate the resonance stabilized carbanion, which is a species containing carbon with a negative charge

2) The formation of a tetrahedral intermediate occurs by the nucleophilic addition of the carbanion to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The acetic acid produced during the reaction protonates the tetrahedral intermediate.

3) In this step, the elimination of acetic acid is followed by the hydrolysis of the unsaturated molecule resulting in the production of cinnamic acid.

#### Perkin reaction mechanism 2

Under the influence of the base, the anhydride gives the carbanion. This carbanion now attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.
This attack yields an intermediate. The abstraction of a proton from the active methyl group of the intermediate by the given base and the subsequent elimination of the hydroxyl group gives unsaturated anhydride.
This product is now hydrolyzed to finally give alpha, beta-unsaturated acid. The illustration of the Perkin reaction mechanism is given below.

### synthesis cinnamaldehyde from cinnamic acid

CAR and PPTase enzymes: Biocatalysts have been gaining extra attention in recent decades due to their industrial-relevance properties, which may hasten the transition to a cleaner environment. Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) are large, multi-domain proteins that can catalyze the reduction of carboxylic acids to corresponding aldehydes, with the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This biocatalytic reaction is of great interest due to the abundance of carboxylic acids in nature and the ability of CAR to convert carboxylic acids to a wide range of aldehydes essentially needed as end products such as vanillin or reaction intermediates for several compounds production such as alcohols, alkanes, and amines. This modular enzyme, found in bacteria and fungi, demands an activation via post-translational modification by the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). Recent advances in the characterization and structural studies of CARs revealed valuable information about the dynamics, mechanisms, and unique features of the enzymes. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the previous findings on the phylogeny, structural and mechanistic insight of the domains, post-translational modification requirement, strategies for the cofactors regeneration, the extensively broad aldehyde-related industrial application properties of CARs, as well as their recent immobilization approaches.

Aldehyde oxidoreductase (carboxylic acid reductase (Car)) catalyzes the magnesium-, ATP-, and NADPH-dependent reduction of carboxylic acids to their corresponding aldehydes. Heterologous expression of the car gene in Escherichia coli afforded purified recombinant enzyme with a specific activity nearly 50-fold lower than that of purified native Nocardia sp. enzyme. The 5-fold increase in specific activity obtained by incubating purified recombinant Car with CoA and Nocardia cell-free extracts indicated that post-translational phosphopantetheinylation of Car is required for maximum enzyme activity. Nocardia phosphopantetheine transferase (PPTase) expressed in E. coli was isolated and characterized. When incubated with [3H]acetyl-CoA and Nocardia PPTase, the labeled acetylphosphopantetheine moiety was incorporated into recombinant Car. Coexpression of Nocardia Car and PPTase in E. coli gave a reductase with nearly 20-fold higher specific activity. Site-directed mutagenesis in which Ser689 was replaced with Ala resulted in an inactive Car mutant. The results show that Car expressed in Escherichia coli is an apoenzyme that is converted to a holoenzyme by post-translational modification via phosphopantetheinylation. Doubly recombinant resting E. coli cells efficiently reduce vanillic acid to vanillin.
