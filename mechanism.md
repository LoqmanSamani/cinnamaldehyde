## Mechanism of the synthesis of Cinnamaldehyde from Benzaldehyde and acetic acid anhydride

### Perkin reaction

Perkin’s reaction mechanism includes the reaction between **aromatic aldehydes**, the **aliphatic acid anhydride**, 
and the **alkali salt** of the acid to give **cinnamic acid** derivatives.

#### Perkin reaction mechanism 1

The reaction is initiated by heating the aldehyde with an excess of acid anhydride to 180°C. Typically, the reaction’s conditions lead to dehydration, which produces an anhydride. Unsaturated acid is produced by hydrolyzing the anhydride with diluted HCl after excess aldehyde has been removed by distillation under steam.

The reaction mechanism of the Perkin reaction can be explained as follows:

1) The carboxylate ion abstracts a proton to generate the resonance stabilized carbanion, which is a species containing carbon with a negative charge

2) The formation of a tetrahedral intermediate occurs by the nucleophilic addition of the carbanion to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The acetic acid produced during the reaction protonates the tetrahedral intermediate.

3) In this step, the elimination of acetic acid is followed by the hydrolysis of the unsaturated molecule resulting in the production of cinnamic acid.

#### Perkin reaction mechanism 2

Under the influence of the base, the anhydride gives the carbanion. This carbanion now attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.
This attack yields an intermediate. The abstraction of a proton from the active methyl group of the intermediate by the given base and the subsequent elimination of the hydroxyl group gives unsaturated anhydride.
This product is now hydrolyzed to finally give alpha, beta-unsaturated acid. The illustration of the Perkin reaction mechanism is given below.
