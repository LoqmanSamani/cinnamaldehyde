## Cinnamaldehyde


### Introduction

**Cinnamaldehyde** is an organic compound with the formula **C9 H8 O**  or **C6 H5 CH=CH CHO**. Occurring naturally as predominantly the **trans (E) isomer**, it gives cinnamon its flavor and odor[1]. It is a **phenylpropanoid** that is naturally synthesized by the **shikimate pathway**[2]. This pale yellow, viscous liquid occurs in the bark of cinnamon trees and other species of the **genus Cinnamomum**. The essential oil of cinnamon bark is about 90% cinnamaldehyde[3]. Cinnamaldehyde decomposes to **styrene** because of oxidation as a result of bad storage or transport conditions. Styrene especially forms in high humidity and high temperatures. This is the reason why cinnamon contains small amounts of styrene[4].


### Structure and synthesis

Cinnamaldehyde was isolated from cinnamon essential oil in 1834 by **Jean-Baptiste Dumas** and **Eugène-Melchior Péligot**[5] and synthesized in the laboratory by the Italian chemist **Luigi Chiozza** in 1854.[6]

The natural product is trans-cinnamaldehyde. The molecule consists of a benzene ring attached to an unsaturated aldehyde. As such, the molecule can be viewed as a derivative of acrolein. Its color is due to the π → π* transition: increased conjugation in comparison with acrolein shifts this band towards the visible.[7]

#### Biosynthesis

1) **deamination** of **L-phenylalanine** into **cinnamic acid** by the action of **phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)**.[9][10] (PAL catalyzes this reaction by a non-oxidative deamination. This deamination relies on the MIO prosthetic group of PAL.[11])

2) **4-coumarate–CoA ligase (4CL)** converts **cinnamic acid** to **cinnamoyl-CoA** by an **acid–thiol ligation**.[9] 4CL uses **ATP** to catalyze the formation of cinnamoyl-CoA.[12] 4CL effects this reaction in two steps.[13] 4CL forms a **hydroxycinnamate–AMP anhydride**, followed by a **nucleophile attack** on the carbonyl of the acyl adenylate.[14] 

3) **Cinnamoyl-CoA** is reduced by **NADPH** catalyzed by **CCR (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase)** to form **cinnamaldehyde**.[9][15]
