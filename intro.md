## Cinnamaldehyde


### Cinnamaldehyde

**Cinnamaldehyde**, a captivating organic compound denoted by the chemical formula **C9 H8 O** or **C6 H5 CH=CH CHO**, stands as the aromatic cornerstone that imparts both flavor and fragrance to the beloved spice, cinnamon[1](https://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/gewuerze/zimt/zimt.htm/). Found predominantly in its **trans (E) isomer** form, this pale yellow, viscous liquid is a prominent member of the **phenylpropanoid** family, naturally synthesized through the intricate **shikimate pathway**[2](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Plant+Natural+Products%3A+Synthesis%2C+Biological+Functions+and+Practical+Applications-p-9783527682003).

Nestled within the bark of cinnamon trees and other botanical wonders belonging to the **genus Cinnamomum**, cinnamaldehyde takes center stage, comprising approximately 90% of the essential oil extracted from cinnamon bark[3](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/637511). Its delicate aroma and distinctive taste have made it an indispensable component in culinary and perfumery realms alike.

However, the journey of cinnamaldehyde is not without its nuances. The compound's susceptibility to decomposition, particularly under suboptimal storage or transport conditions, leads to the emergence of **styrene**. The occurrence of styrene is notably influenced by environmental factors such as elevated humidity and temperatures, contributing to the subtle presence of this secondary compound in cinnamon[4](https://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/high_daily_intakes_of_cinnamon_health_risk_cannot_be_ruled_out.pdf).


### Structure and Synthesis


#### Isolation and Laboratory Synthesis

The journey of understanding cinnamaldehyde's structure commenced in 1834 when the collaborative efforts of **Jean-Baptiste Dumas** and **Eugène-Melchior Péligot** led to its isolation from cinnamon essential oil[5](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6568974z/f311.image.r). Subsequently, in 1854, Italian chemist **Luigi Chiozza** achieved a significant milestone by synthesizing this aromatic compound in the laboratory[6](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2999t/f226.item.r=.zoom).

The inherent elegance of cinnamaldehyde lies in its molecular composition. Primarily existing as the **trans-cinnamaldehyde isomer**, the molecule is a captivating fusion of a **benzene ring** and an **unsaturated aldehyde**. This unique structure positions it as a derivative of **acrolein**, with the distinct color attributed to the π → π* transition. The enhanced conjugation relative to acrolein subtly shifts this transition band towards the visible spectrum, contributing to its characteristic hue[7].

#### Biosynthesis 

The orchestration of cinnamaldehyde's creation within nature unfolds through a meticulous biosynthetic journey:

1. **Deamination**
   - The performance begins with the deamination of **L-phenylalanine** orchestrated by the enzyme **phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)**. This non-oxidative deamination, reliant on PAL's MIO prosthetic group, transforms L-phenylalanine into **cinnamic acid**[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719340/)![10](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021925819617217).

2. **4CL Artistry:**
   - The narrative progresses with the involvement of **4-coumarate–CoA ligase (4CL)**, which orchestrates a captivating acid–thiol ligation. This enzyme converts **cinnamic acid** into **cinnamoyl-CoA** using **ATP** as a catalyst. The intricate dance involves two steps: the formation of a hydroxycinnamate–AMP anhydride, succeeded by a nucleophile attack on the carbonyl of the acyl adenylate[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003269701955745?via%3Dihub)[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC35134/)[14](https://www.cell.com/structure/fulltext/S0969-2126(15)00362-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0969212615003627%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).

3. **CCR's Final Act:**
   - The grand finale unfolds as **cinnamoyl-CoA** takes center stage, undergoing reduction catalyzed by **NADPH** under the guidance of **CCR (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase)**. This transformative act gives rise to the masterpiece – **cinnamaldehyde**[15](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1976.tb10370.x).
