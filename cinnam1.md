Trans Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to possess substantial antimicrobial activity, as well as an array of other medicinal properties, and represents an intriguing hit compound from which a number of derivatives have been developed

Cinnamon spice is obtained from the inner bark of several trees within the genus Cinnamomum, which itself is comprised of approximately 250 plant species [11,12]. The most common species are C.
cassia (Chinese cinnamon, commonly referred to as Cassia) and C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum, commonly referred to as true cinnamon). These two species contain a varying percentage of cinnamaldehyde with up to 85.3% and 90.5% reported, respectively [11].
trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been identiﬁed as the component that gives rise to much of the reported antimicrobial properties of this spice [9,12–16]. Isolated cinnamaldehyde has been shown to eﬀectively inhibit the growth of an array of microorganisms such as bacteria,
moulds, and yeasts, as well as having been reported to inhibit toxin production by micro-organisms [8,9,13,17,18].

trans-Cinnamaldehyde is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Flavour and Extract Manufacturer's Association (FEMA), and has been granted A status (i.e. may be used in foodstuﬀs) by the Council of Europe [17].
On this basis, trans-Cinnamaldehyde can be viewed as a safe food and ﬂavour additive, with a pleasant taste and odour, and has found many commercial food uses [15,17]. Cinnamon has been a useful spice since biblical times, when it was utilized as a perfume in rubbing oils [11].
Egyptians employed cinnamon as a fragrance for preserving bodies [11]and more recently, trans-cinnamaldehyde has been used agriculturally as a fungicide [19]. Cinnamaldehyde has also been incorporated into edible antimicrobial ﬁlms, prepared from foodstuﬀs such as fruit and
vegetables, and has inactivated foodborne pathogens either by direct contact or by vapours released from the ﬁlms in closed containers [20]. These ﬁlms have also been shown to reduce the presence of non-pathogenic spoilage organisms that impact food quality [17].

There have been some undesirable aspects reported for trans-cinnamaldehyde that has limited its commercial use. For one, the solubility of this compound in water is low at approximately 1.1 g/L at 20 °C
[19]. It is also sensitive when exposed to light and air for prolonged periods [19]. In vivo, it is possible that trans-cinnamaldehyde decomposes to cinnamic acid by enzyme catalysis before it is able to elicit its antibacterial activity, hence could be considered unstable in blood [12].
Cinnamaldehyde is a known sensitizer in humans and the North American Contact Dermatitis Research group have reported that cinnamaldehyde is a frequent cause of allergic reactions as a constituent of perfumes and cosmetics [11].

trans-cinnamaldehyde, as well as its derivatives, as potential anti-tumour and anti-cancer agents. Trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to be active against a number of cancer cell lines, including A549 lung, SK-OV-3 ovarian, and XF-498 central nerve system cell lines [25]
Notably, trans-cinnamaldehyde exhibited comparable activity to anticancer agents such as cisplatin with respect to HeLa epithelioid cervix, SK-MEL-2 melanoma, and HCT-15 colon tumour cells [25].
A number of synthetic cinnamaldehyde derivatives including 2-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde, 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-5-ﬂuorocinnamaldehyde, CB403 and a number of synthesized dimer analogues as well as naturally-occurring 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde and
2-methoxycinnamaldheyde (Fig. 1, structure 2–7) have demonstrated anti-cancer properties against a range of cancer cell lines.

synthesized a range of cinnamaldehyde derivatives in order to identify their anti-tumour mechanism of action and characterised these compounds as cyclin dependent kinases (CDK)4 inhibitors. Research in this area has placed a focus on cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes as there is
growing evidence that its activity is vital for proliferation of many tumours [40].
The cardioprotection and related activity of cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives has also been studied. X.-Q Li et al. [41] assessed the therapeutic eﬀects of cinnamaldehyde and ﬁve derivatives on viral myocarditis (VMC).
The potential of trans-cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives as anti-inﬂammatory agents has also been reported. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of inﬂammatory and immune genes. Reddy et al. [45] identiﬁed trans-cinnamaldehyde and
naturally occurring 2-methoxycinnamaldehdye (Fig. 1, structure 1 & 7)as NF-κB inhibitors, which were shown not only to inhibit its transcriptional activity but also to inhibit its lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-in-duced DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner.

Cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives have been have been screened against several pathogenic fungi and shown to exhibit antifungal activity against Aspergillus ﬂavus [49,50], Aspergillus fumi-
gatus and Trichophyton rubrum [51], Coriolus versicolor and Laetiporus sulphurous [52], Aspergillus ochraceus as well as its associated toxin [53,54], and Candida spp including some ﬂuconazole-resistant strains
[55,56]. Interestingly, cis-cinnamaldehyde, the geometrical isomer of trans-cinnamaldehyde, has also been shown to possess antifungal properties [57].
Interestingly, commercial cinnamon preparations containing trans-cinnamaldehyde and o-methoxycinnamaldehyde also gave relief to three out of ﬁve HIV patients with oral candidiasis [62].
Masamoto et al. [66] also found that cinnamaldehyde enhanced thermogenesis and inhibited heat diﬀusion.

2. [Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of cinnamaldehyde](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-016-0415-9) - [2](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/2.pdf)

Plant parasitic nematodes are harmful to agricultural crops and plants, and may cause severe yield losses. Cinnamaldehyde, a volatile, yellow liquid commonly used as a flavoring or food additive, is increasingly becoming a popular natural nematicide because of its high nematicidal activity and, there is a high demand for the development of a biological platform to produce cinnamaldehyde.
In E. coli, cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from intracellular l-phenylalanine, which requires the activities of three enzymes: phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR).

Nematicides are chemical pesticides that eliminate parasitic nematodes on plants. They can be employed with success, although currently there are several disadvantages: (i) it is necessary to pay particular attention to the chemical pesticide used in
many susceptible plants and crops, (ii) non-selectivity of the pesticide may occasionally cause elimination of other organisms in addition to nematodes, and (iii) if the pathogen remains after treatment, the damage may be severely exacerbated [8, 9].
the specific molecule cinnamaldehyde, which is present in cinnamon bark oil, is attractive as a pesticide because of its potent nematicidal activity [12, 13].

Cinnamaldehyde is currently obtained by chemical synthesis from benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde or by direct extraction from cinnamon bark oil. However, there are disadvantages with these methods: (i) it is difficult to separate other cinnamalde-
hyde derivatives and stereoisomers during its chemical production, and (ii) extraction requires the logging and consumption of plants [16]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of an eco-friendly and efficient biological system to produce cinnamaldehyde.
In this study, we sought to engineer Escherichia coli as a microbial cell factory for the production of cinnamaldehyde by construction of the biosynthesis pathway for the production of cinnamaldehyde. Based
on in vitro assays of enzyme activities, three biosynthetic enzymes, phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) were cloned into gene expression constructs. We also manipulated metabolic pathways in E.
coli to increase the intracellular pool of l-phenylalanine, which is the main precursor of cinnamaldehyde.

Cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from l-phenylalanine and its biosynthesis requires three enzymatic reactions: (i) deamination of l-phenylalanine into cinnamic acid by phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.24),
(ii) acid-thiol ligation of cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA by 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL, EC 6.2.1.12), and(iii) reduction of cinnamoyl-CoA to cinnamaldehyde by cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR, EC 1.2.1.44) (Fig. 1a)
[17–20]. PAL is a ubiquitous enzyme that can be found in many plants, fungi, and some bacteria, and it harbors diverse activities and specificities according to the origin of the enzyme [18, 21].
