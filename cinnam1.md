Trans Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to possess substantial antimicrobial activity, as well as an array of other medicinal properties, and represents an intriguing hit compound from which a number of derivatives have been developed

Cinnamon spice is obtained from the inner bark of several trees within the genus Cinnamomum, which itself is comprised of approximately 250 plant species [11,12]. The most common species are C.
cassia (Chinese cinnamon, commonly referred to as Cassia) and C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum, commonly referred to as true cinnamon). These two species contain a varying percentage of cinnamaldehyde with up to 85.3% and 90.5% reported, respectively [11].
trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been identiﬁed as the component that gives rise to much of the reported antimicrobial properties of this spice [9,12–16]. Isolated cinnamaldehyde has been shown to eﬀectively inhibit the growth of an array of microorganisms such as bacteria,
moulds, and yeasts, as well as having been reported to inhibit toxin production by micro-organisms [8,9,13,17,18].

trans-Cinnamaldehyde is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Flavour and Extract Manufacturer's Association (FEMA), and has been granted A status (i.e. may be used in foodstuﬀs) by the Council of Europe [17].
On this basis, trans-Cinnamaldehyde can be viewed as a safe food and ﬂavour additive, with a pleasant taste and odour, and has found many commercial food uses [15,17]. Cinnamon has been a useful spice since biblical times, when it was utilized as a perfume in rubbing oils [11].
Egyptians employed cinnamon as a fragrance for preserving bodies [11]and more recently, trans-cinnamaldehyde has been used agriculturally as a fungicide [19]. Cinnamaldehyde has also been incorporated into edible antimicrobial ﬁlms, prepared from foodstuﬀs such as fruit and
vegetables, and has inactivated foodborne pathogens either by direct contact or by vapours released from the ﬁlms in closed containers [20]. These ﬁlms have also been shown to reduce the presence of non-pathogenic spoilage organisms that impact food quality [17].

There have been some undesirable aspects reported for trans-cinnamaldehyde that has limited its commercial use. For one, the solubility of this compound in water is low at approximately 1.1 g/L at 20 °C
[19]. It is also sensitive when exposed to light and air for prolonged periods [19]. In vivo, it is possible that trans-cinnamaldehyde decomposes to cinnamic acid by enzyme catalysis before it is able to elicit its antibacterial activity, hence could be considered unstable in blood [12].
Cinnamaldehyde is a known sensitizer in humans and the North American Contact Dermatitis Research group have reported that cinnamaldehyde is a frequent cause of allergic reactions as a constituent of perfumes and cosmetics [11].

trans-cinnamaldehyde, as well as its derivatives, as potential anti-tumour and anti-cancer agents. Trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to be active against a number of cancer cell lines, including A549 lung, SK-OV-3 ovarian, and XF-498 central nerve system cell lines [25]
Notably, trans-cinnamaldehyde exhibited comparable activity to anticancer agents such as cisplatin with respect to HeLa epithelioid cervix, SK-MEL-2 melanoma, and HCT-15 colon tumour cells [25].
A number of synthetic cinnamaldehyde derivatives including 2-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde, 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-5-ﬂuorocinnamaldehyde, CB403 and a number of synthesized dimer analogues as well as naturally-occurring 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde and
2-methoxycinnamaldheyde (Fig. 1, structure 2–7) have demonstrated anti-cancer properties against a range of cancer cell lines.

synthesized a range of cinnamaldehyde derivatives in order to identify their anti-tumour mechanism of action and characterised these compounds as cyclin dependent kinases (CDK)4 inhibitors. Research in this area has placed a focus on cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes as there is
growing evidence that its activity is vital for proliferation of many tumours [40].
The cardioprotection and related activity of cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives has also been studied. X.-Q Li et al. [41] assessed the therapeutic eﬀects of cinnamaldehyde and ﬁve derivatives on viral myocarditis (VMC).
The potential of trans-cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives as anti-inﬂammatory agents has also been reported. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of inﬂammatory and immune genes. Reddy et al. [45] identiﬁed trans-cinnamaldehyde and
naturally occurring 2-methoxycinnamaldehdye (Fig. 1, structure 1 & 7)as NF-κB inhibitors, which were shown not only to inhibit its transcriptional activity but also to inhibit its lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-in-duced DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner.

Cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives have been have been screened against several pathogenic fungi and shown to exhibit antifungal activity against Aspergillus ﬂavus [49,50], Aspergillus fumi-
gatus and Trichophyton rubrum [51], Coriolus versicolor and Laetiporus sulphurous [52], Aspergillus ochraceus as well as its associated toxin [53,54], and Candida spp including some ﬂuconazole-resistant strains
[55,56]. Interestingly, cis-cinnamaldehyde, the geometrical isomer of trans-cinnamaldehyde, has also been shown to possess antifungal properties [57].
Interestingly, commercial cinnamon preparations containing trans-cinnamaldehyde and o-methoxycinnamaldehyde also gave relief to three out of ﬁve HIV patients with oral candidiasis [62].
Masamoto et al. [66] also found that cinnamaldehyde enhanced thermogenesis and inhibited heat diﬀusion.

2. [Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of cinnamaldehyde](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-016-0415-9) - [2.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/2.pdf)

Plant parasitic nematodes are harmful to agricultural crops and plants, and may cause severe yield losses. Cinnamaldehyde, a volatile, yellow liquid commonly used as a flavoring or food additive, is increasingly becoming a popular natural nematicide because of its high nematicidal activity and, there is a high demand for the development of a biological platform to produce cinnamaldehyde.
In E. coli, cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from intracellular l-phenylalanine, which requires the activities of three enzymes: phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR).

Nematicides are chemical pesticides that eliminate parasitic nematodes on plants. They can be employed with success, although currently there are several disadvantages: (i) it is necessary to pay particular attention to the chemical pesticide used in
many susceptible plants and crops, (ii) non-selectivity of the pesticide may occasionally cause elimination of other organisms in addition to nematodes, and (iii) if the pathogen remains after treatment, the damage may be severely exacerbated [8, 9].
the specific molecule cinnamaldehyde, which is present in cinnamon bark oil, is attractive as a pesticide because of its potent nematicidal activity [12, 13].

Cinnamaldehyde is currently obtained by chemical synthesis from benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde or by direct extraction from cinnamon bark oil. However, there are disadvantages with these methods: (i) it is difficult to separate other cinnamalde-
hyde derivatives and stereoisomers during its chemical production, and (ii) extraction requires the logging and consumption of plants [16]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of an eco-friendly and efficient biological system to produce cinnamaldehyde.
In this study, we sought to engineer Escherichia coli as a microbial cell factory for the production of cinnamaldehyde by construction of the biosynthesis pathway for the production of cinnamaldehyde. Based
on in vitro assays of enzyme activities, three biosynthetic enzymes, phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) were cloned into gene expression constructs. We also manipulated metabolic pathways in E.
coli to increase the intracellular pool of l-phenylalanine, which is the main precursor of cinnamaldehyde.

Cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from l-phenylalanine and its biosynthesis requires three enzymatic reactions: (i) deamination of l-phenylalanine into cinnamic acid by phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.24),
(ii) acid-thiol ligation of cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA by 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL, EC 6.2.1.12), and(iii) reduction of cinnamoyl-CoA to cinnamaldehyde by cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR, EC 1.2.1.44) (Fig. 1a)
[17–20]. PAL is a ubiquitous enzyme that can be found in many plants, fungi, and some bacteria, and it harbors diverse activities and specificities according to the origin of the enzyme [18, 21].

3. [Construction and yield optimization of a cinnamylamine biosynthesis route in Escherichia coli](https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-022-02199-7) - [3.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/3.pdf)

Cinnamylamine is an aromatic compound derived from l-phenylalanine, which is used in the synthesis of biologically active molecules, including drugs, and energetic materials.
The ω-aminotransferase Cv-ωTA from Chromobacterium violaceum has been demonstrated to have high enzyme activity in the conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamylamine. To prevent the preferable conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in wild-type Escherichia coli, the E. coli MG1655 strain with reduced aromatic alde-
hyde reduction (RARE) in which six aldehyde ketone reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes have been knocked out was employed. Then, the carboxylic acid reductase from Neurospora crassa (NcCAR) and phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) from E. coli were screened for a high conversion rate of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde.
We achieved the first biosynthesis of cinnamylamine using cinnamic acid as the precursor in E. coli using a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy.

The microbial production of aromatic compounds is an attractive method because it has the advantages of environmental friendliness, low cost, and feedstock renew ability, compared with other synthetic methods [1–6].
The process of synthesizing cinnamylamine by chemical synthesis is relatively mature and has a high conversion rate. But the way to chemically synthesize cinnamylamine usually requires conditions such as high temperature, high
pressure and metal catalysts. It has the disadvantages of high energy consumption, environmental pollution and low safety [13–15].

Cinnamaldehyde has two biosynthetic pathways. In the first, phenylalanine lyase catalyzes the generation of cinnamic acid from phenylalanine that is produced by the shikimate pathway. Then, 4-coumaric acid: CoA ligase (4CL) catalyzes the formation of
cinnamoyl-CoA from cinnamic acid, and then cinnamaldehyde is formed from cinnamoyl-CoA under catalysis by cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) [16, 19–25]. In the other pathway, catalysis by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and phosphoubiquitin transferase (PPTase)
reduces cinnamic acid into cinnamaldehyde [2, 17, 26–32].
cinnamaldehyde has been synthetized in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Corynebacterium glutamicum [16–18].

NADH is a required cofactor for the conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, we believe that the intracellular NADH levels affect the accumulation of cinnamyl alcohol (Fig. 2A). The reducing power pro-
vided by different carbon sources is also different, so we optimized the carbon source used in the fermentation medium. Three different fermentation media were compared for cinnamylamine production: LB with 2%
glucose; LB with 2% xylose; and LB. Using LB medium supplemented with the precursor cinnamaldehyde for fermentation, the MRE-oE strain produced 11.03 mg/L cinnamylamine with minimal accumulation of cinnamyl alcohol (0.34 mg/L) after 4 h (Fig. 2E). In contrast,
the addition of glucose or xylose resulted in less cinnamylamine production and excess cinnamyl alcohol accumulation. In addition, the intracellular content of NADH decreased sequentially in the MRE-oE strains cultured in LB with glucose, LB with xylose, and LB medium, which was consistent with the accumulated concentrations of
cinnamyl alcohol (Additional file 5: Fig. S2). Excess glucose or xylose may provide redundant NADH reducing power for the cell, which may have caused the accumulation of cinnamyl alcohol.

The reduction of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized by a two-step catalytic reaction, through cinnamoyl-CoA, using 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) and cinnamyl-CoA reductase (CCR), or it can be catalyzed in one step by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) (Fig. 3A).

We successfully improved the catalytic efficiency of transaminase through semi-rational design. However, a large amount of cinnamic acid remained after the fermentation, and the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde
was less. We speculated that the conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde was the rate-limiting step. The conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde requires NADPH as a cofactor. Therefore, we investigated increasing the levels of intracellular NADPH to promote the
conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde. To increase intracellular NADPH levels, we expressed an NADH kinase that converts NADH to NADPH.

5. [Production of Cinnamaldehyde through Whole-Cell Bioconversion from trans-Cinnamic Acid Using Engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07398?casa_token=p49dMAwhzmwAAAAA%3AoDa4H1cyPpOAFKVLpn0SgF70MunmZnAG0xBeoPOIKbF0t7PuAnGcU6GKHjoIjiv9NXhvFTyG0gRgFkQ) - [5]()

Cinnamaldehyde (CAD) has various applications in foods and pharmaceuticals and has gained prominence as a potent nematicide in agricultural research owing to its nematicidal activity. However, conventional methods of CAD production,
including extraction from plants or organic chemical synthesis, are environmentally hazardous and limit its utilization for downstream applications. Here, we engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum as a whole-cell biocatalyst for the eﬃcient bioconversion
of trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) into CAD. An expression module of Mycobacterium phlei carboxylic acid reductase was constructed for the conversion of t-CA to CAD. Additionally, the putative dehydrogenase-related genes (dkgA, adhC, and cg1176) responsible for
the conversion of CAD to cinnamyl alcohol were deleted from the engineered C. glutamicum strain to prevent the loss of CAD. Furthermore, as the conversion is NADPH-dependent, we investigated the conversion eﬃciency by exchanging the putative promoter region for the zwf gene, which encodes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, with a strong promoter to increase the
NADPH pool. Finally, a bioconversion platform using C. glutamicum as a whole-cell biocatalyst was developed by deleting the vdh gene, which is involved in the reverse conversion of CAD to t-CA. Taken together, a 100% conversion yield of 1.1 g/L CAD from 1.2 g/L t-CA was obtained within 30 min.

CAD has been found to inhibit food pathogens/food spoilage bacteria and prevent infection of plants by parasitic nematodes, one of the causes of crop productivity loss.1,2 Furthermore, in terms of medical applications, CAD has
been reported to be eﬀective in inhibiting cancer cells that have metastasized to the lungs, ovaries, and central nervous system, as well as to promote exothermic and metabolic reactions that are important in downregulating obesity in humans and mice.3,4.
CAD can be extracted from cinnamon plants; however, CAD production in plants is dependent on the plant’s life cycle, climatic conditions, and susceptibility to plant diseases. Meanwhile, organic chemical synthesis of CAD is
cost-eﬀective and accounts for the majority of CAD production so far. Organic chemical synthesis is the primary method for CAD production, where a benzaldehyde derivative reacts with acetaldehyde under alkaline conditions; however, byproducts
produced during the synthesis can act as factors causing environmental pollution and have the potential to cause safety issues in downstream applications.5

compared to the L-Phe or trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) production titers, the CAD production titer still needs to be improved. The low CAD production titer may be attributed to the unknown properties of endogenous genes that may be involved in the synthesis
process from L-Phe to CAD, as well as optimal biosynthetic conditions that compete with each other in the metabolic pathway can inhibit high CAD production. Furthermore, the potential toxicity of CAD due to the reactivity of the aldehyde group hinders the accumulation of CAD during the cultivation.7

C. glutamicum is regarded as a promising host for industrially relevant biotechnological production owing to the following characteristics: (i) it has a capability for high-cell-density growth resulting in a high yield
of target products; (ii) being recognized as a safe host for production; (iii) recent advances in optimized genetic tools for C. glutamicum enable a wide range of industrial applications.11 As a result, many studies have recently reported a whole-cell
biocatalyst design using C. glutamicum to produce various chemicals, including phenylpropanoid-derived com- pounds.12−17 We previously reported on the engineering of C. glutamicum for the biosynthesis of t-CA from L-Phe.18

We ﬁrst constructed an expression system for the Mycobacterium phlei carboxylic acid reductase (MpCAR) gene for the direct conversion of t-CA to CAD (Figure 2A). The putative genes involved in the
conversion of CAD to cinnamyl alcohol (CAL) were then deleted in C. glutamicum in order to increase the CAD bioconversion yield. Furthermore, we examined the conversion eﬃciency by increasing the pool of NADPH, a cofactor required for t-CA conversion. Finally, the vdh gene was deleted
to prevent the reverse conversion of the produced CAD to t-CA, and the bioconversion process with C. glutamicum as a whole-cell biocatalyst was developed with high CAD conversion eﬃciency.

Whole-Cell Bioconversion in a Bioreactor. C. glutamicum strains were seeded in a BHI medium. After cultivation for 12 h, the cells were transferred into 200 mL of modiﬁed CGXII medium in four
250 mL baﬄed ﬂasks. The seed culture was poured into 1.8 L of fresh modiﬁed CGXII medium in a 5 L jar bioreactor (BioCNS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The cultivation temperature was set at 30 °C until the cells reached the stationary phase. While the cells were
growing up to the stationary phase, the pH was controlled at pH 7 with 20% (v/v) sulfuric acid and 5 M ammonia solution. After the cells reached the stationary phase, i.e., after 8 h of cultivation, 500 mL of fermentation broth containing 6 g/L of t-CA23 was added to the
cells for the conversion of t-CA to CAD. The fermentation broth containing t-CA was prepared as a cell-free substrate in the same manner as described above. All conversion reactions were performed at 200 rpm and 30 °C.
