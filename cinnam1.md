Trans Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to possess substantial antimicrobial activity, as well as an array of other medicinal properties, and represents an intriguing hit compound from which a number of derivatives have been developed

Cinnamon spice is obtained from the inner bark of several trees within the genus Cinnamomum, which itself is comprised of approximately 250 plant species [11,12]. The most common species are C.
cassia (Chinese cinnamon, commonly referred to as Cassia) and C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum, commonly referred to as true cinnamon). These two species contain a varying percentage of cinnamaldehyde with up to 85.3% and 90.5% reported, respectively [11].
trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been identiﬁed as the component that gives rise to much of the reported antimicrobial properties of this spice [9,12–16]. Isolated cinnamaldehyde has been shown to eﬀectively inhibit the growth of an array of microorganisms such as bacteria,
moulds, and yeasts, as well as having been reported to inhibit toxin production by micro-organisms [8,9,13,17,18].

trans-Cinnamaldehyde is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Flavour and Extract Manufacturer's Association (FEMA), and has been granted A status (i.e. may be used in foodstuﬀs) by the Council of Europe [17].
On this basis, trans-Cinnamaldehyde can be viewed as a safe food and ﬂavour additive, with a pleasant taste and odour, and has found many commercial food uses [15,17]. Cinnamon has been a useful spice since biblical times, when it was utilized as a perfume in rubbing oils [11].
Egyptians employed cinnamon as a fragrance for preserving bodies [11]and more recently, trans-cinnamaldehyde has been used agriculturally as a fungicide [19]. Cinnamaldehyde has also been incorporated into edible antimicrobial ﬁlms, prepared from foodstuﬀs such as fruit and
vegetables, and has inactivated foodborne pathogens either by direct contact or by vapours released from the ﬁlms in closed containers [20]. These ﬁlms have also been shown to reduce the presence of non-pathogenic spoilage organisms that impact food quality [17].

There have been some undesirable aspects reported for trans-cinnamaldehyde that has limited its commercial use. For one, the solubility of this compound in water is low at approximately 1.1 g/L at 20 °C
[19]. It is also sensitive when exposed to light and air for prolonged periods [19]. In vivo, it is possible that trans-cinnamaldehyde decomposes to cinnamic acid by enzyme catalysis before it is able to elicit its antibacterial activity, hence could be considered unstable in blood [12].
Cinnamaldehyde is a known sensitizer in humans and the North American Contact Dermatitis Research group have reported that cinnamaldehyde is a frequent cause of allergic reactions as a constituent of perfumes and cosmetics [11].

trans-cinnamaldehyde, as well as its derivatives, as potential anti-tumour and anti-cancer agents. Trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to be active against a number of cancer cell lines, including A549 lung, SK-OV-3 ovarian, and XF-498 central nerve system cell lines [25]
Notably, trans-cinnamaldehyde exhibited comparable activity to anticancer agents such as cisplatin with respect to HeLa epithelioid cervix, SK-MEL-2 melanoma, and HCT-15 colon tumour cells [25].
A number of synthetic cinnamaldehyde derivatives including 2-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde, 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-5-ﬂuorocinnamaldehyde, CB403 and a number of synthesized dimer analogues as well as naturally-occurring 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde and
2-methoxycinnamaldheyde (Fig. 1, structure 2–7) have demonstrated anti-cancer properties against a range of cancer cell lines.

synthesized a range of cinnamaldehyde derivatives in order to identify their anti-tumour mechanism of action and characterised these compounds as cyclin dependent kinases (CDK)4 inhibitors. Research in this area has placed a focus on cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes as there is
growing evidence that its activity is vital for proliferation of many tumours [40].
The cardioprotection and related activity of cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives has also been studied. X.-Q Li et al. [41] assessed the therapeutic eﬀects of cinnamaldehyde and ﬁve derivatives on viral myocarditis (VMC).
The potential of trans-cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives as anti-inﬂammatory agents has also been reported. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of inﬂammatory and immune genes. Reddy et al. [45] identiﬁed trans-cinnamaldehyde and
naturally occurring 2-methoxycinnamaldehdye (Fig. 1, structure 1 & 7)as NF-κB inhibitors, which were shown not only to inhibit its transcriptional activity but also to inhibit its lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-in-duced DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner.

Cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives have been have been screened against several pathogenic fungi and shown to exhibit antifungal activity against Aspergillus ﬂavus [49,50], Aspergillus fumi-
gatus and Trichophyton rubrum [51], Coriolus versicolor and Laetiporus sulphurous [52], Aspergillus ochraceus as well as its associated toxin [53,54], and Candida spp including some ﬂuconazole-resistant strains
[55,56]. Interestingly, cis-cinnamaldehyde, the geometrical isomer of trans-cinnamaldehyde, has also been shown to possess antifungal properties [57].
Interestingly, commercial cinnamon preparations containing trans-cinnamaldehyde and o-methoxycinnamaldehyde also gave relief to three out of ﬁve HIV patients with oral candidiasis [62].
Masamoto et al. [66] also found that cinnamaldehyde enhanced thermogenesis and inhibited heat diﬀusion.

2. [Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of cinnamaldehyde](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-016-0415-9) - [2.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/2.pdf)

Plant parasitic nematodes are harmful to agricultural crops and plants, and may cause severe yield losses. Cinnamaldehyde, a volatile, yellow liquid commonly used as a flavoring or food additive, is increasingly becoming a popular natural nematicide because of its high nematicidal activity and, there is a high demand for the development of a biological platform to produce cinnamaldehyde.
In E. coli, cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from intracellular l-phenylalanine, which requires the activities of three enzymes: phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR).

Nematicides are chemical pesticides that eliminate parasitic nematodes on plants. They can be employed with success, although currently there are several disadvantages: (i) it is necessary to pay particular attention to the chemical pesticide used in
many susceptible plants and crops, (ii) non-selectivity of the pesticide may occasionally cause elimination of other organisms in addition to nematodes, and (iii) if the pathogen remains after treatment, the damage may be severely exacerbated [8, 9].
the specific molecule cinnamaldehyde, which is present in cinnamon bark oil, is attractive as a pesticide because of its potent nematicidal activity [12, 13].

Cinnamaldehyde is currently obtained by chemical synthesis from benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde or by direct extraction from cinnamon bark oil. However, there are disadvantages with these methods: (i) it is difficult to separate other cinnamalde-
hyde derivatives and stereoisomers during its chemical production, and (ii) extraction requires the logging and consumption of plants [16]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of an eco-friendly and efficient biological system to produce cinnamaldehyde.
In this study, we sought to engineer Escherichia coli as a microbial cell factory for the production of cinnamaldehyde by construction of the biosynthesis pathway for the production of cinnamaldehyde. Based
on in vitro assays of enzyme activities, three biosynthetic enzymes, phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) were cloned into gene expression constructs. We also manipulated metabolic pathways in E.
coli to increase the intracellular pool of l-phenylalanine, which is the main precursor of cinnamaldehyde.

Cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from l-phenylalanine and its biosynthesis requires three enzymatic reactions: (i) deamination of l-phenylalanine into cinnamic acid by phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.24),
(ii) acid-thiol ligation of cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA by 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL, EC 6.2.1.12), and(iii) reduction of cinnamoyl-CoA to cinnamaldehyde by cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR, EC 1.2.1.44) (Fig. 1a)
[17–20]. PAL is a ubiquitous enzyme that can be found in many plants, fungi, and some bacteria, and it harbors diverse activities and specificities according to the origin of the enzyme [18, 21].

3. [Construction and yield optimization of a cinnamylamine biosynthesis route in Escherichia coli](https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-022-02199-7) - [3.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/3.pdf)

Cinnamylamine is an aromatic compound derived from l-phenylalanine, which is used in the synthesis of biologically active molecules, including drugs, and energetic materials.
The ω-aminotransferase Cv-ωTA from Chromobacterium violaceum has been demonstrated to have high enzyme activity in the conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamylamine. To prevent the preferable conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in wild-type Escherichia coli, the E. coli MG1655 strain with reduced aromatic alde-
hyde reduction (RARE) in which six aldehyde ketone reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes have been knocked out was employed. Then, the carboxylic acid reductase from Neurospora crassa (NcCAR) and phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) from E. coli were screened for a high conversion rate of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde.
We achieved the first biosynthesis of cinnamylamine using cinnamic acid as the precursor in E. coli using a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy.

The microbial production of aromatic compounds is an attractive method because it has the advantages of environmental friendliness, low cost, and feedstock renew ability, compared with other synthetic methods [1–6].
The process of synthesizing cinnamylamine by chemical synthesis is relatively mature and has a high conversion rate. But the way to chemically synthesize cinnamylamine usually requires conditions such as high temperature, high
pressure and metal catalysts. It has the disadvantages of high energy consumption, environmental pollution and low safety [13–15].

Cinnamaldehyde has two biosynthetic pathways. In the first, phenylalanine lyase catalyzes the generation of cinnamic acid from phenylalanine that is produced by the shikimate pathway. Then, 4-coumaric acid: CoA ligase (4CL) catalyzes the formation of
cinnamoyl-CoA from cinnamic acid, and then cinnamaldehyde is formed from cinnamoyl-CoA under catalysis by cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) [16, 19–25]. In the other pathway, catalysis by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and phosphoubiquitin transferase (PPTase)
reduces cinnamic acid into cinnamaldehyde [2, 17, 26–32].
cinnamaldehyde has been synthetized in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Corynebacterium glutamicum [16–18].

NADH is a required cofactor for the conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, we believe that the intracellular NADH levels affect the accumulation of cinnamyl alcohol (Fig. 2A). The reducing power pro-
vided by different carbon sources is also different, so we optimized the carbon source used in the fermentation medium. Three different fermentation media were compared for cinnamylamine production: LB with 2%
glucose; LB with 2% xylose; and LB. Using LB medium supplemented with the precursor cinnamaldehyde for fermentation, the MRE-oE strain produced 11.03 mg/L cinnamylamine with minimal accumulation of cinnamyl alcohol (0.34 mg/L) after 4 h (Fig. 2E). In contrast,
the addition of glucose or xylose resulted in less cinnamylamine production and excess cinnamyl alcohol accumulation. In addition, the intracellular content of NADH decreased sequentially in the MRE-oE strains cultured in LB with glucose, LB with xylose, and LB medium, which was consistent with the accumulated concentrations of
cinnamyl alcohol (Additional file 5: Fig. S2). Excess glucose or xylose may provide redundant NADH reducing power for the cell, which may have caused the accumulation of cinnamyl alcohol.

The reduction of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized by a two-step catalytic reaction, through cinnamoyl-CoA, using 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) and cinnamyl-CoA reductase (CCR), or it can be catalyzed in one step by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) (Fig. 3A).

We successfully improved the catalytic efficiency of transaminase through semi-rational design. However, a large amount of cinnamic acid remained after the fermentation, and the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde
was less. We speculated that the conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde was the rate-limiting step. The conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde requires NADPH as a cofactor. Therefore, we investigated increasing the levels of intracellular NADPH to promote the
conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde. To increase intracellular NADPH levels, we expressed an NADH kinase that converts NADH to NADPH.

4. [Production of trans‑cinnamic acid by whole‑cell bioconversion from l‑phenylalanine in engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12934-021-01631-1) - [4.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/4.pdf)

An expression module based on a phenylalanine ammonia lyase-encoding gene from Streptomyces maritimus (SmPAL), which mediates the conversion of l-Phe into t-CA, was constructed in C. glutamicum. Using the strong
promoter ­PH36 and ribosome binding site (RBS) (in front of gene 10 of the T7 phage), and a high-copy number plasmid, SmPAL could be expressed to levels as high as 39.1% of the total proteins in C. glutamicum. Next, to improve t-CA
production at an industrial scale, reaction conditions including temperature and pH were optimized; t-CA production reached up to 6.7 mM/h in a bioreactor under optimal conditions (50 °C and pH 8.5, using NaOH as base solution).
Finally, a recycling system was developed by coupling membrane filtration with the bioreactor, and the engineered C.glutamicum successfully produced 13.7 mM of t-CA (24.3 g) from 18.2 mM of l-Phe (36 g) and thus with a yield of 75% (0.75 mol/mol) through repetitive supplementation.

t-CA can be isolated from plants; however, this method has not yet overcome the low yield because it is difficult to optimize environmental and geographic conditions [7]. In addition, t-CA
can be synthesized by the organic chemical synthesis method: a condensation reaction of acetic anhydride and benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium acetate [8–10]. Although the chemical synthesis accounts for the largest portion of t-CA production so far, it is an energy intensive and non-green process because it requires high temperature condition and fossil resources [11, 12].

Naturally, t-CA can be synthesized from l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) [13]. Generally, compared to the chemical synthesis-based
production process, the production of whole-cell biocatalyst-based chemicals using microorganisms offers several advantages: (i) environmentally friendly production,
(ii) high regioselectivity, and (iii) cofactor regeneration for multi-step reactions [20]. However, to achieve a high production yield in whole-cell biocatalyst-based production, a microorganism that can satisfy the following con-
ditions is required: (i) being recognized as a safe host for production, (ii) high-cell density cultures, (iii) the ability to easily induce high expression of the genes coding for heterologous proteins, and (iv) maintenance of cell
viability during harsh conditions, e.g., changes in temperature or pH [21, 22].

In an earlier study, we engineered E. coli for the production of t-CA and obtained up to 6.9 g/L of t-CA by fed-batch cultivation with an engineered strain [19]. Although this titer
was the highest ever recorded, the productivity was not high (0.138 g/L/h) because of the long cultivation (86 h)[19]. For improving this time, a modification in the reaction temperature was considered. As shown here, SmPAL
showed its highest activity at 50 °C; an activity four times higher than that at 30 °C (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, E. coli and most bacterial hosts cannot be cultivated at 50 °C
but are generally grown between 30 and 37 °C at which the activity of the PAL enzyme is not high enough. This temperature difference is one of the hurdles to be solved in the production of t-CA using microorganisms. In con-
trast to E. coli, C. glutamicum has a very rigid cell wall structure, which consists of mycolic acid, arabinogalactan, and a peptidoglycan layer [43]. Due to this distinct structure, C. glutamicum is known for its high tolerance
to various chemicals and extreme conditions such as high temperature, pH, and detergents, so it has served as a robust and potential platform for the production of toxic chemicals and production under extreme conditions[44–46].

5. [Production of Cinnamaldehyde through Whole-Cell Bioconversion from trans-Cinnamic Acid Using Engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07398?casa_token=p49dMAwhzmwAAAAA%3AoDa4H1cyPpOAFKVLpn0SgF70MunmZnAG0xBeoPOIKbF0t7PuAnGcU6GKHjoIjiv9NXhvFTyG0gRgFkQ) - [5.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/5.pdf)

Cinnamaldehyde (CAD) has various applications in foods and pharmaceuticals and has gained prominence as a potent nematicide in agricultural research owing to its nematicidal activity. However, conventional methods of CAD production,
including extraction from plants or organic chemical synthesis, are environmentally hazardous and limit its utilization for downstream applications. Here, we engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum as a whole-cell biocatalyst for the eﬃcient bioconversion
of trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) into CAD. An expression module of Mycobacterium phlei carboxylic acid reductase was constructed for the conversion of t-CA to CAD. Additionally, the putative dehydrogenase-related genes (dkgA, adhC, and cg1176) responsible for
the conversion of CAD to cinnamyl alcohol were deleted from the engineered C. glutamicum strain to prevent the loss of CAD. Furthermore, as the conversion is NADPH-dependent, we investigated the conversion eﬃciency by exchanging the putative promoter region for the zwf gene, which encodes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, with a strong promoter to increase the
NADPH pool. Finally, a bioconversion platform using C. glutamicum as a whole-cell biocatalyst was developed by deleting the vdh gene, which is involved in the reverse conversion of CAD to t-CA. Taken together, a 100% conversion yield of 1.1 g/L CAD from 1.2 g/L t-CA was obtained within 30 min.

CAD has been found to inhibit food pathogens/food spoilage bacteria and prevent infection of plants by parasitic nematodes, one of the causes of crop productivity loss.1,2 Furthermore, in terms of medical applications, CAD has
been reported to be eﬀective in inhibiting cancer cells that have metastasized to the lungs, ovaries, and central nervous system, as well as to promote exothermic and metabolic reactions that are important in downregulating obesity in humans and mice.3,4.
CAD can be extracted from cinnamon plants; however, CAD production in plants is dependent on the plant’s life cycle, climatic conditions, and susceptibility to plant diseases. Meanwhile, organic chemical synthesis of CAD is
cost-eﬀective and accounts for the majority of CAD production so far. Organic chemical synthesis is the primary method for CAD production, where a benzaldehyde derivative reacts with acetaldehyde under alkaline conditions; however, byproducts
produced during the synthesis can act as factors causing environmental pollution and have the potential to cause safety issues in downstream applications.5

compared to the L-Phe or trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) production titers, the CAD production titer still needs to be improved. The low CAD production titer may be attributed to the unknown properties of endogenous genes that may be involved in the synthesis
process from L-Phe to CAD, as well as optimal biosynthetic conditions that compete with each other in the metabolic pathway can inhibit high CAD production. Furthermore, the potential toxicity of CAD due to the reactivity of the aldehyde group hinders the accumulation of CAD during the cultivation.7

C. glutamicum is regarded as a promising host for industrially relevant biotechnological production owing to the following characteristics: (i) it has a capability for high-cell-density growth resulting in a high yield
of target products; (ii) being recognized as a safe host for production; (iii) recent advances in optimized genetic tools for C. glutamicum enable a wide range of industrial applications.11 As a result, many studies have recently reported a whole-cell
biocatalyst design using C. glutamicum to produce various chemicals, including phenylpropanoid-derived com- pounds.12−17 We previously reported on the engineering of C. glutamicum for the biosynthesis of t-CA from L-Phe.18

We ﬁrst constructed an expression system for the Mycobacterium phlei carboxylic acid reductase (MpCAR) gene for the direct conversion of t-CA to CAD (Figure 2A). The putative genes involved in the
conversion of CAD to cinnamyl alcohol (CAL) were then deleted in C. glutamicum in order to increase the CAD bioconversion yield. Furthermore, we examined the conversion eﬃciency by increasing the pool of NADPH, a cofactor required for t-CA conversion. Finally, the vdh gene was deleted
to prevent the reverse conversion of the produced CAD to t-CA, and the bioconversion process with C. glutamicum as a whole-cell biocatalyst was developed with high CAD conversion eﬃciency.

Whole-Cell Bioconversion in a Bioreactor. C. glutamicum strains were seeded in a BHI medium. After cultivation for 12 h, the cells were transferred into 200 mL of modiﬁed CGXII medium in four
250 mL baﬄed ﬂasks. The seed culture was poured into 1.8 L of fresh modiﬁed CGXII medium in a 5 L jar bioreactor (BioCNS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The cultivation temperature was set at 30 °C until the cells reached the stationary phase. While the cells were
growing up to the stationary phase, the pH was controlled at pH 7 with 20% (v/v) sulfuric acid and 5 M ammonia solution. After the cells reached the stationary phase, i.e., after 8 h of cultivation, 500 mL of fermentation broth containing 6 g/L of t-CA23 was added to the
cells for the conversion of t-CA to CAD. The fermentation broth containing t-CA was prepared as a cell-free substrate in the same manner as described above. All conversion reactions were performed at 200 rpm and 30 °C.

Several aldehydes are responsible for flavors and fragrances present in plants, but aldehydes are not known to accumulate in most natural microorganisms. In many cases, microbial production of aldehydes presents an attractive alternative to extraction from plants or chemical synthesis.
Aromatic aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, anisaldehyde, vanillin, and cinnamaldehyde, are responsible for the natural fragrances of almond, sweet blossom, vanilla, and cinnamon, respectively (6, 7).
The high reactivity of the carbonyl
group of aldehydes enables many industrial uses beyond flavors
and fragrances, such as precursors to pharmaceuticals (12–15).
However, the high reactivity of aldehydes also contributes to their
increased toxicity in microorganisms. Given the high-value applications and large markets for several aldehydes, commercial focus on microbial aldehyde synthesis has surged in recent years (16).
Because most microbes do not naturally accumulate aldehydes,
microbial production of these molecules from simple carbon
sources requires at least two parallel approaches: pathway construction for product generation and strain engineering for product accumulation.

7. [Pathway engineering for the production of heterologous aromatic chemicals and their derivatives in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: bioconversion from glucose](https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article/17/4/fox035/3861259) - [7.pdf](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/cinnamaldehyde/blob/systembiology/literature/7.pdf)

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively engineered for optimising its performance as a microbial cell factory to
produce valuable aromatic compounds and their derivatives as bulk and fine chemicals. The production of heterologous
aromatic molecules in yeast is achieved via engineering of the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is
connected to two pathways of the central carbon metabolism, and is highly regulated at the gene and protein level.
the shikimate pathway and the tyrosine and phenylalanine
biosynthetic pathway of S. cerevisiae for biosynthesis of aromatic chemicals and their derivatives from glucose.

In S. cerevisiae, aromatic compounds are synthesised via
the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway (AAP) (Braus
1991). This highly regulated pathway is a central node of yeast
metabolism and feeds several other pathways (i.e. quinone, folate and Ehrlich pathways). Its core constitutes of the shikimate
pathway, from which two main pathways for amino acid production branch out: the tryptophan, and the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch (Fig. 1).

The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate
(DAHP) synthase catalyses the initiating step into the AAP. It
facilitates the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and
erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), thereby releasing phosphate. PEP
is an intermediate of the lower part of glycolysis, whereas E4P
is derived from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Fig. 1).
However, on glucose under aerobic conditions, the available
carbon flux to E4P is significantly lower than the flux to PEP
(Vaseghi et al. 1999). Therefore, balancing the ratio of the two
substrates and increasing their availability seems to be a
promising step towards increasing the flux into the AAP.
Using flux balance analysis, Curran et al. (2013) could show
that optimizing the availability of E4P requires a shift in the
PPP. Normally, flux enters into the PPP through the glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by ZWF1, reducing the maximum theoretical carbon yield due to the release of CO2 in the
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase reaction. E4P is then produced by transaldolase in the non-oxidative part of the PPP,
which is the limiting step of the pathway (Becker and Boles
2003). Moreover, in the next step, transketolase rather consumes
E4P and converts it together with xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P)
to produce fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate (G3P). Therefore, in order to optimise synthesis of
E4P, ZWF1 was deleted and TKL1-encoding transketolase was
overexpressed to reverse flux from the glycolytic intermediates
F6P and G3P to E4P and X5P (Fig. 1). This resulted in an up
to 7-fold increase of the flux into the AAP (Deaner and Alper
2017). Another approach to improve the flux towards the AAP is
the overexpression of transaldolase (Tal1) and enolase 2 (Eno2)
(Mao et al. 2017).

The shikimic acid pathway directly provides precursors for heterologous products, such as vanillin and muconic acid. Furthermore, some of the seven reaction steps of the pathway are targets for improvement of downstream pathways and product yields
The first enzymatic step of the pathway is catalysed by
DAHP synthase, which condenses E4P and PEP into DAHP. ARO3
and ARO4 encode for two DAHP synthase isoforms in yeast.
The DAHP synthase reaction represents an important target in
metabolic engineering approaches. The two protein isoforms
Aro3 and Aro4 catalysing this reaction are feedback inhibitable
by phenylalanine and tyrosine, respectively (Braus 1991).
The following enzymatic steps in the pathway are exerted
by the pentafunctional enzyme Arom, encoded by ARO1. Arom
converts DAHP into 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP)
through five reactions, which include the cyclisation of the
molecule, generating 3-dehydroquinate (3-DHQ), and introduc-
tion of the first double bond of the aromatic ring, forming the intermediate 3-dehydroshikimate (3-DHS) (Fig. 2). 3-DHS is converted to shikimate in an NADPH-dependent reaction. Subsequently, shikimate-3-phosphate is formed from shikimate and
ATP. In the last reaction step, EPSP is produced from shikimate-3-phosphate and PEP. Due to its five catalytic domains (C-, E-,
D-, B- and A-domain), Arom is considered as a natural scaffold
for substrate channelling (Duncan, Edwards and Coggims 1987).
The seventh and last step of the shikimate pathway is catalysed by a chorismate synthase, encoded by ARO2. Aro2, which
requires the cofactor flavin mononucleotide (FMN), acts by removing a phosphate and introducing the second double bond
of the aromatic ring, converting EPSP into chorismate (Jones,
Reusser and Braus 1991; Quevillon-Cheruel et al. 2004).

Focusing now solely on the phenylalanine branch, another series of valuable fine and bulk chemicals was produced via
metabolic engineering in yeast. These compounds, namely
pinocembrin DHC, styrene, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol
and hydrocinnamyl alcohol find applications in the medical
field, like pinocembrin DHC and cinnamaldehyde; in the cosmetic industry, like cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol and hydrocinnamyl alcohol; and in the plastic production field, like
styrene.
A shared entry step for the biosynthesis of these compounds
exists. It is catalysed by PALs, converting phenylalanine to transcinnamic acid. This step was achieved by several groups, as
already mentioned in this minireview (Koopman et al. 2012;
McKenna et al. 2014b; Gottardi et al. 2017).
Pinocembrin DHC is part of the previously described DHCs.
The set of reactions that allowed for the production of phloretin
from p-coumaric acid was implemented from trans-cinnamic
acid on (Eichenberger et al. 2017).

we engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a microbial host to produce trans-cinnamic acid derivatives cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamyl alcohol, and hydrocinnamyl alcohol, from externally added trans-cinnamic acid or de novo from glucose
as a carbon source. We show that the desired products can
be de novo synthesized in S. cerevisiae via the heterologous overexpression of the genes encoding phenylalanine
ammonia lyase 2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPAL2), aryl
carboxylic acid reductase (acar) from Nocardia sp., and
phosphopantetheinyl transferase (entD) from Escherichia
coli, together with endogenous alcohol dehydrogenases.

9. [Simple phenylpropanoids: recent advances in biological activities, biosynthetic pathways, and microbial production]() - [9.pdf]()

Simple phenylpropanoids are a group of secondary metabolites
comprising a phenyl ring linked with a three-carbon side chain
(C6–C3). In plants, they are primarily derived from the aromatic
amino acid L-phenylalanine (L-Phe).1 These compounds can be
classied into several subcategories associated with changes in
the substituent on the benzene ring and the position of the
propenyl double bond, such as phenylpropanoic acids (cin-
namic and hydroxycinnamic acids), phenylpropanoic alde-
hydes, phenylpropanols, phenylpropene and simple coumarins.2
Plants synthesize approximately 10 gigatons of phenyl-
propanoid molecules each year, which constitute approxi-
mately 20% of the total carbon in the terrestrial biosphere.7
Compared to plant extraction
and chemical synthesis, microbial production is a promising
alternative, not only for its much shorter production periods but
also for being safer, low-cost, and environmentally friendly.
However, despite the tremendous progress
made, several urgent challenges remain in advancing microbial
engineering as a general approach for the biosynthesis of simple
phenylpropanoids, including (1) non-specicity and ineﬃcient
cofactor supply of enzymes, (2) unbalanced metabolic ux
between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), (3) low
cell performance, and (4) metabolic promiscuity in single cells.
Due to their perfuming, anti-
oxidant and ultraviolet (UV) protection properties, trans-cin-
namic acid (t-CA) and its derivatives, such as cinnamyl
aldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, have been widely
used in cosmetics for decades.21

Simple phenylpropanoids, such as t-
CA, cinnamyl alcohol, have been utilized as functional ingre-
dients for natural food preservatives because of their antimi-
crobial activities.25,26 Cinnamyl aldehyde is the most potent
antimicrobial substance in cinnamon, and is active against
multiple bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sub-
tilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella
anatum, as well as many fungi.27 trans-Cinnamyl aldehyde is
identied as Generally Recognized as Safe by the United States
Food and Drug Administration, and has not only served as
a fungicide in agriculture, but is also added into edible anti-
microbial lms for inhibition of foodborne pathogens.28
CaA has been shown to relieve chronic infections induced
by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses), mainly
through membrane disruption and depolarisation, by
damaging DNA and protein structures, by downregulating
virulence genes, and by inhibiting cellular proliferation.29
a mouse experiment evaluated the anti-
viral eﬀects of t-CA against Zika virus.31 These plant-derived
compounds have the potential to be used as a nutraceutical or
drug candidate against pandemics.
t-CA and its deriv-
atives have benecial eﬀects on diabetes and its complications. It
regulates glucose metabolism by improving glucose tolerance
and stimulating insulin secretion. Cinnamic aldehydes are
eﬀective in improving insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial
function.33
Treatment with CaA
has been reported to selectively remove induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) without aﬀecting normal and iPSC-derived
diﬀerentiated cells, indicating that it can be used as a safe
and economical anti-teratoma agent in iPSCs-based therapy.41
Hydroxycinnamic acids can show
neuroprotective and pro-cognitive eﬀects by modulating
oxidant machinery and inammatory status.18 Hydroxycin-
namic acids can also activate autophagy and limit brain
damage by breaking down misfolded proteins and dysfunc-
tional mitochondria.47
The
mechanisms of t-CA and cinnamic aldehyde on ameliorating
glucolipid metabolism are similar in mouse experiments and
can improve mitochondrial function, reduce serotonin content
and upregulate autophagy-mediated lipid clearance.55

The biosynthesis of simple phenyl-
propanoids are derived from the aromatic amino acids (AAAs) L-
Phe and L-tyrosine (L-Tyr) in plants (Fig. 2). As nodes connecting
primary and secondary metabolism, L-Phe and L-Tyr are syn-
thesised from chorismate (CHA) via the AAA pathway. The
condensation of two core precursors, phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP), derived from glycolysis, and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P),
derived from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), leads to
a metabolic ux into the shikimate pathway for CHA synthesis.
Therefore, the biosynthetic pathways of simple phenyl-
propanoids can be divided into primary metabolism and plant-
specic phenylpropanoid metabolism. Except for plant-specic
CO2 xation (shown in green in Fig. 2), the AAA biosynthetic
pathway is relatively conserved in plants and microorganisms
(shown in red in Fig. 2). Biosynthetic pathways of simple phe-
nylpropanoids and their derived complex phenylpropanoids
usually exist in plants.
Plants absorb carbon dioxide to produce sugar, whereas
glucose is the most direct carbon source for cellular biomass in
bacteria and fungi. Central carbon metabolism converts glucose
to PEP and E4P via glycolysis and nonoxidative steps in the PPP,
respectively. Notably, PPP is related to the redox cofactor
NADPH, which is critical for several downstream enzymes and
the normal cellular energy metabolism.66,67 The pathway con-
necting central carbon metabolism and the AAA network is the
shikimate pathway, which comprises seven enzymatic reactions
and is ubiquitous in plants, fungi and bacteria.68 As the rst
committed step, studies have shown that the aldol condensa-
tion of PEP and E4P to produce 3-deoxy-D-arabino-
heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) in a reaction catalysed by
DAHP synthase is a rate limiting reaction.69–71
The following steps to generate the nal product of the shi-
kimate pathway, chorismate (CHA), are typically supported by
individual monofunctional enzymes in plants and E. coli,
including 3-dehydroquinate synthase (Dhps), 3-dehydroquinate
dehydratase (Dqd), shikimate dehydrogenase (Sdh), shikimate
kinase (Sk), 5-enolpyruvate-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase
(Epsp synthase) and chorismate synthase (CS), whereas in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a penta-functional protein (Arom) can
directly catalyse the reaction of DAHP to 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-
3-phosphate (EPSP).72,73 As a key branching point of the primary
metabolic pathway to make aromatic amino acids, CHA rstly
forms prephenate (PPA) in a reaction catalysed by chorismate
mutase (Cm). The subsequent conversion to Phe and Tyr occurs
via two routes in plants. One is conserved in both plants and
microorganisms, where PPA catalyses the synthesis of L-Phe by
prephenate dehydratase (Pdt) and phenylpyruvate aminotrans-
ferase (Ppy-at) or L-Tyr by prephenate dehydrogenase (Pdh) and 4-
hydroxyphenylpyruvate aminotransferase (Hpp-at). PPA is con-
verted to L-arogenate (AGN) by prephenate aminotransferase
(Ppa-at), which is then converted in reactions catalysed by
arogenate dehydratase (Adt) or arogenate dehydrogenase (Adh) to
74,75
L-Phe or L-Tyr, respectively.
The biosynthetic pathway producing simple phenyl-
propanoids that occurs in plants has been heterologously
established in microorganisms—the specic pathways involved
are described in the following section. The conversion of L-Phe
to t-CA is catalysed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (Pal).
Studies have demonstrated that the broad substrate spectrum
of Pal includes L-Phe and L-Tyr, and that the reverse reaction to
76
L-Phe can also be catalysed by Pal in the presence of ammonia.
t-CA is modied by the hydroxylation and methylation of the
aromatic ring, giving rise to hydroxycinnamic acids. Among
these, p-HCA can also be directly formed from the deamination
of L-Tyr by the bifunctional Phe/Tyr ammonia-lyase (PTal)
enzyme from monocot grasses of the Poaceae family, or from
some bacterial and fungal species.77 The enzyme 4-coumarate-
CoA ligase (4Cl) catalyses the conversion of phenylpropanoic
acids to the coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters, which are then con-
verted to the corresponding aldehydes by cinnamoyl-CoA
reductase (Ccr), and subsequently to phenylpropanols by cin-
namyl alcohol dehydrogenase (Cad), and simple coumarins by
2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2Ogd). Furthermore,
simple phenylpropanoids are considered basic building blocks
for downstream decorations to produce large quantities of
secondary metabolites, such as avonoids, stilbenes, lignans,
polyphenols, and condensed tannins.65 These complex phenyl-
propanoids and their derivatives have various biological and
commercial values and are being intensively evaluated.78

As the compounds connecting the microbial innate pathway
and the plant allogenic pathway, L-Phe and L-Tyr obtain carbon
uxes from the central carbon metabolic and shikimate path-
ways for the synthesis of simple phenylpropanoids (Fig. 2).
Reprogramming the primary metabolic ux to AAAs (L-Phe and
L-Tyr) is the basis for the high-level synthesis of simple phe-
nylpropanoids. Therefore, the construction of a microbial cell
factory for the eﬃcient synthesis of simple phenylpropanoids
requires two steps: construction of an AAA high-producing
chassis (Fig. 3) and introduction and optimization of simple
phenylpropanoid pathways (Fig. 4).
Multilevel metabolic engineering strategies have been studied to
overproduce AAAs (L-Phe and L-Tyr), such as rewiring central
carbon metabolism, relieving negative regulation, eliminating
by-product formation, and engineering transport processes
(Fig. 3). To rewire the central carbon ux towards the AAA
pathway, an improved supply of PEP and E4P is required. The
PPP is the exclusive pathway for glucose conversion to E4P, and
its optimization is crucial for E4P supply. Since S. cerevisiae tends
to quickly introduce metabolic ux into glycolysis for ethanol
fermentation under anaerobic conditions and limits PPP, the
deciency of E4P is a major problem.79 In addition, E4P has been
reported to be the primary limiting substrate for AAA biosyn-
thesis in some bacteria, such as E. coli, B. subtilis, and Coryne-
bacterium glutamicum.80–82 In S. cerevisiae, the optimization
strategy for PPP depends on cell culture conditions because the
upstream (Zwf and Gnd) and downstream (Tkl and Tal) enzymes
of PPP are rate-limiting steps for E4P synthesis under high- and
low-glucose concentrations, respectively.83 Therefore, diﬀerent
strategies should be used for PPP optimization to accommodate
the use of high- and low-glucose-induced promoters.83–85 A novel
PHK pathway consisting of phosphoketolase (Xfpk) can split
xylose 5-phosphate (X5P) and/or fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) into
acetyl-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)/E4P,
which is critical for rewiring the carbon metabolism of glycol-
ysis into E4P.86 Therefore, simultaneous expression of Xfpk, Tal,
and Tkl can signicantly increase the metabolic ux towards E4P
in S. cerevisiae.83 Although S. cerevisiae is not able to use xylose as
a sole carbon source, it is clear that metabolic ux enters the PPP
faster for E4P synthesis when xylose is used, which may be useful
in further improving the E4P supply in yeast.87 In contrast with
E4P, carbon ow towards PEP is usually suﬃcient because of its
important position in glycolysis. Construction of a non-PTS route
in E. coli has been proven to avoid PEP loss for glucose transport,
(>50%), thereby supporting the synthesis of downstream AAA.88
The availability of PEP and E4P can also be improved by
adjusting the activity of precursor pathway enzymes, such as by
deletion of pyruvate kinases (encoded by PYKA and PYKF), or by
over-expression of PEP synthase (encoded by PPSA), trans-
ketolase (encoded by TKTA) and/or transaldolase (encoded by
TALB).89–91 It is reasonable that the carbon ux between PEP and
E4P is signicantly diﬀerent, thus it is essential to balance the
availability of E4P and PEP (increase E4P and decrease PEP) to
maintain high productivity. Promoter engineering by ne-tuning
the strength of glycolysis and PEP alleviated this limitation in S.
cerevisiae.92,93

to facilitate product synthesis. In E. coli, the bifunctional enzyme
(YdiB) was replaced by the monofunctional enzyme (AroE) to
reduce the by-product formation of quinate in the shikimate
pathway.94 In S. cerevisiae, increased ux in the AAA biosynthetic
pathway results in the accumulation of undesired fusel alcohol/
acids via the Ehrlich pathway, which can be relieved by
a double knock-out of phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10) and
pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc5).95 Interestingly, a recent report has
found that the deletion of a novel gene HTZ1 signicantly
increased the tyrosine-producing capacity of yeast cells, although
the underlying mechanism remains to be elaborated.96 Primary
metabolism is strictly regulated by microorganisms, including
yeasts. At the enzyme activity level, metabolic ux is controlled
mainly by AAA-mediated feedback inhibition in the rst and post-
chorismate steps in the above-mentioned biosynthetic pathways.
By protein structure analysis with site directed mutagenesis, the
feedback-resistant (r) variants such as aro4K229L and aro7G141S
have been widely utilized in S. cerevisiae to eliminate the allo-
steric regulation for the enhancement of the corresponding AAAs
and derived metabolites.71,97,98 CSRA, encoding the carbon-
storage regulator of E. coli, regulates enzymes in glycolysis, and
over 2- fold increase in yield of L-Phe were achieved when CsrA
was disrupted.99 TyrR is the tyrosine repressor that negatively
regulate several genes transcription of Tyr-producing pathway in
E. coli, and inactivation of TyrR led to an increase in the L-Tyr
biosynthesis.100,101 Transport engineering contributes to strain
development by addressing substrate uptake and product output,
as well as loss of intermediates. The tyrosine-specic transporters
TyrP and TyrR were mutated in E. coli overexpressing aroGDr,
aroL and tyrC, leading to a maximum L-Tyr titre of 43.14 g L−1 by
fed-batch fermentation.102
Notably, the regulation of cell growth and highly tailored
production should be carried out in an optimal and sustainable
manner. A synthetic RNA (sRNA) strategy was employed in E.
coli to ne-tune target gene expression, which could coordinate
the ux balance between L-Tyr production and biomass accu-
mulation.103 Adaptive laboratory evolution could also be useful
as a way of enhancing the robustness of engineered strains. A
Pseudomonas putida S12 mutant strain highly accumulating L-
Phe was successfully screened by a combination of random
mutagenesis and selection of toxic analogs.104 Recently, with the
aid of biosensors as a high-throughput screening tool,
recombinant strains with the desired properties for enhanced
AAAs are likely to be identied in high eﬃciency.105,106
Researchers have explored the potential of non-conventional
microbial chassis to generate AAAs, such as Yarrowia lipolytica
and C. glutamicum, which have been an attractive platform
optimized for aromatic compounds production.107,108

Cinnamic acid is the
non-oxidative deamination product of L-Phe in a reaction cata-
lysed by Pal and mostly occurs in the trans conguration (t-CA)
(Fig. 4). Pal is the starting and limiting enzyme in the simple
phenylpropanoids biosynthetic pathway, hence much eﬀort has
been made in identifying high-eﬃciency alternative enzymes
for functional expression in heterologous microbes.109,110 The
production titre of t-CA reached 6.9 g L−1 by heterologous
expression of an eﬃcient SmPal from Streptomyces maritimus in
an engineered L-Phe-overproducing E. coli, together with culti-
vation optimization and casamino acid supplementation in a 2
litre bioreactor.111 In order to further optimize the catalytic
function of SmPal, the combination of a SmPal-based whole-cell
biocatalyst in C. glutamicum and a crossow membrane-based
cell recycling system was designed to produce t-CA from L-Phe
with a yield of 75% (0.75 mol mol−1).112 An alternative pathway
harbouring a phenyllactate dehydratase encoded by FLDABCI
genes from Clostridium sporogenes was developed for additional
t-CA production from D-phenyllactate (Fig. 4), which exceeded
the Pal-dependent pathway to achieve an 11-fold increase in t-
CA yield.113 Most recently, a high-density culture system of the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 successfully
synthesized approximately 0.8 g L−1 t-CA from CO2 as the
carbon source,114 which indicates that exploiting the primary
metabolism of cyanobacteria has great potential for the green
and sustainable production of phenylpropanoids. As the cyto-
toxicity of t-CA impairs cell proliferation, researchers have
found that near-neutral culture pH and alcoholic carbon source
might be useful to improve the cellular tolerance to t-CA
inhibition.115

Simple
phenyl-
propanoic aldehydes include cinnamaldehyde, p-coumar-
aldehyde,
caﬀeoylaldehyde,
coniferaldehyde,
and
sinapaldehyde. Phenylpropanoic aldehydes are produced from
phenylpropanoic acids by the actions of two enzymes, 4Cl and
Ccr, in which the CoA thioester of the 4Cl products is converted
to an aldehyde group using NADPH (Fig. 4). The co-expression
of three plant enzymes Pal, 4Cl, and Ccr in E. coli achieved
cinnamaldehyde production from L-Phe.161 The fusion of 4Cl1-
Ccr was functionally overexpressed in E. coli to construct
a metabolic channel for improved production of p-coumar-
aldehyde, caﬀealdehyde and coniferaldehyde from feedstocks
consisting of the corresponding phenylpropanoic acids.162 In
addition, a novel microbial pathway consisting of an aryl
carboxylic acid reductase (Car) and a phosphopantetheinyl
transferase (EntD) were shown to synthesize cinnamaldehyde
from t-CA without the presence of plant 4Cl. The de novo
biosynthesis of cinnamaldehyde was carried out in L-Phe-
overproducing S. cerevisiae using glucose as a substrate.163
Although the de novo biosynthesis of cinnamaldehyde was
achieved in a strain of S. cerevisiae producing high levels of L-
Phe, cell growth was aﬀected by the concentration of cinna-
maldehyde, and some unanticipated metabolites such as cin-
namyl alcohol were detected in the fermentation broth. The
toxicity of aldehyde chemicals is harmful to the growth and
metabolism of microbes, which provides a reasonable expla-
nation for the absence of natural accumulation of aldehydes in
microorganisms.164 In contrast, the endogenous Aldh and
alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) in S. cerevisiae are thought to be
spontaneously involved in the reversible conversion of
aldehydes to alcohols and acids and are associated with sugar
metabolism.165 Therefore, the spontaneous conversion from
cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohols may be explained by
a cellular Adh/Aldh-related detoxication mechanism, which
could be an important target for further optimization to
increase the production of aldehydes. By knocking out 10
endogenous Adh and Aldh enzymes and using some necessary
engineering strategies, such as changes to cofactor supply,
enzyme expression enhancement, auto-induction systems,
and engineered E. coli, a maximum cinnamaldehyde titre of
3.8 g L−1 was achieved using glucose.166

Driven by the important applications of simple phenyl-
propanoids, either because of their wide bioactivity or as
precursors for the synthesis of complex natural product mole-
cules, great progress has been achieved in the microbial
production of simple phenylpropanoids (Table S1 provided as
an attachment).† Although many simple phenylpropanoids
have been synthesised at the g L−1 level in microorganisms with
considerable engineering endeavours over the past 20 years,
their titre, yield, and productivity (TYP) still require improve-
ment to achieve industrial production. Some challenges that
limit the high-level synthesis of simple phenylpropanoids must
be addressed. Based on the three-dimensional metabolic engi-
neering strategy proposed in the previous study,11 here we map
these challenges to an upgraded four-dimensional metabolic
engineering strategy (i.e., “point-line-plane-system”), and
suggest a potential technical proposal to meet these challenges

(i) The “Point” level: the unsatised enzyme activity and
cofactor utilization. The catalytic promiscuity
and low cofactor utilisation of enzymes in the simple phenyl-
propanoid pathway are key issues hindering synthetic eﬃ-
ciency.


(ii) The “Line” level: the imbalance of multi-pathway meta-
bolic uxes.
Simple phenylpropanoids are derived from two AAAs (L-Phe
and L-Tyr) condensed from two endogenous intermediates, i.e.,
E4P from PPP and PEP from glycolysis. Therefore, an equal
supply of E4P and PEP is advantageous for the synthesis of
simple phenylpropanoids.

(iii) The “plane” level: the weakness of cell performance.

(iv) The “system” level:
