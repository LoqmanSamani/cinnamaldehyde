1) Cinnamon spice is obtained from the inner bark of several trees within the genus Cinnamomum, which itself is comprised of approximately 250 plant species [11,12]. The most common species are C. cassia (Chinese cinnamon, commonly referred to as Cassia) and C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum, commonly referred to as true cinnamon). These two species contain a varying percentage of cinnamaldehyde with up to 85.3% and 90.5% reported, respectively [11].
There have been some undesirable aspects reported for trans-cinnamaldehyde that has limited its commercial use. For one, the solubility of this compound in water is low at approximately 1.1 g/L at 20 °C [19]. It is also sensitive when exposed to light and air for prolonged periods [19]. In vivo, it is possible that trans-cinnamaldehyde decomposes to cinnamic acid by enzyme catalysis before it is able to elicit its antibacterial activity, hence could be considered unstable in blood [12]. Cinnamaldehyde is a known sensitizer in humans and the North American Contact Dermatitis Research group have reported that cinnamaldehyde is a frequent cause of allergic reactions as a constituent of perfumes and cosmetics [11].

    Trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to be active against a number of cancer cell lines, including A549 lung, SK-OV-3 ovarian, and XF-498 central nerve system cell lines [25]
    X.-Q Li et al. [41] assessed the therapeutic eﬀects of cinnamaldehyde and ﬁve derivatives on viral myocarditis (VMC). The potential of trans-cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives as anti-inﬂammatory agents has also been reported.
    Cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives have shown to exhibit antifungal activity against Aspergillus ﬂavus [49,50], Aspergillus fumi- gatus and Trichophyton rubrum [51], Coriolus versicolor and Laetiporus sulphurous [52], Aspergillus ochraceus as well as its associated toxin [53,54], and Candida spp including some ﬂuconazole-resistant strains [55,56]. 
    

2) In E. coli, cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from intracellular l-phenylalanine, which requires the activities of three enzymes: phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR).
    the specific molecule cinnamaldehyde, which is present in cinnamon bark oil, is attractive as a pesticide because of its potent nematicidal activity. [12, 13] 
    Nematicides are chemical pesticides which have several disadvantages: (i) it is necessary to pay attention to the chemical pesticide used in many susceptible plants and crops, (ii) non-selectivity of the pesticide may cause elimination of other organisms  and (iii) if the pathogen remains after treatment, the damage may be severely exacerbated [8, 9]
    
    In this study, we engineered E.Coli for the production of cinnamaldehyde. Three biosynthetic enzymes, PAL, 4CL and CCR were cloned into E.Coli. We also manipulated metabolic pathways in E.Coli to increase the intracellular pool of l-phenylalanine.

3) To prevent the preferable conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in wild-type Escherichia coli, the E. coli MG1655 strain with reduced aromatic aldehyde reduction (RARE) in which six aldehyde ketone reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes have been knocked out was employed. Then, the carboxylic acid reductase from Neurospora crassa (NcCAR) and phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) from E. coli were screened for a high conversion rate of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde.
   The process of synthesizing cinnamylamine by chemical synthesis is relatively mature and has a high conversion rate. But the way to chemically synthesize cinnamylamine usually requires conditions such as high temperature, high pressure and metal catalysts. It has the disadvantages of high energy consumption, environmental pollution and low safety [13–15].
   
   Cinnamaldehyde has two biosynthetic pathways. In the first, phenylalanine lyase catalyzes the generation of cinnamic acid from phenylalanine that is produced by the shikimate pathway. Then, 4-coumaric acid: CoA ligase (4CL) catalyzes the formation of cinnamoyl-CoA from cinnamic acid, and then cinnamaldehyde is formed from cinnamoyl-CoA under catalysis by cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) [16, 19–25]. In the other pathway, catalysis by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and phosphoubiquitin transferase (PPTase) reduces cinnamic acid into cinnamaldehyde [2, 17, 26–32]. cinnamaldehyde has been synthetized in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Corynebacterium glutamicum [16–18].

   The reduction of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized by a two-step catalytic reaction, through cinnamoyl-CoA, using 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) and cinnamyl-CoA reductase (CCR), or it can be catalyzed in one step by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR).
