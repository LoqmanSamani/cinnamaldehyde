1) Cinnamon spice is obtained from the inner bark of several trees within the genus Cinnamomum, which itself is comprised of approximately 250 plant species [11,12]. The most common species are C. cassia (Chinese cinnamon, commonly referred to as Cassia) and C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum, commonly referred to as true cinnamon). These two species contain a varying percentage of cinnamaldehyde with up to 85.3% and 90.5% reported, respectively [11].
There have been some undesirable aspects reported for trans-cinnamaldehyde that has limited its commercial use. For one, the solubility of this compound in water is low at approximately 1.1 g/L at 20 °C [19]. It is also sensitive when exposed to light and air for prolonged periods [19]. In vivo, it is possible that trans-cinnamaldehyde decomposes to cinnamic acid by enzyme catalysis before it is able to elicit its antibacterial activity, hence could be considered unstable in blood [12]. Cinnamaldehyde is a known sensitizer in humans and the North American Contact Dermatitis Research group have reported that cinnamaldehyde is a frequent cause of allergic reactions as a constituent of perfumes and cosmetics [11].

    Trans-Cinnamaldehyde has been shown to be active against a number of cancer cell lines, including A549 lung, SK-OV-3 ovarian, and XF-498 central nerve system cell lines [25]
    X.-Q Li et al. [41] assessed the therapeutic eﬀects of cinnamaldehyde and ﬁve derivatives on viral myocarditis (VMC). The potential of trans-cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives as anti-inﬂammatory agents has also been reported.
    Cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives have shown to exhibit antifungal activity against Aspergillus ﬂavus [49,50], Aspergillus fumi- gatus and Trichophyton rubrum [51], Coriolus versicolor and Laetiporus sulphurous [52], Aspergillus ochraceus as well as its associated toxin [53,54], and Candida spp including some ﬂuconazole-resistant strains [55,56]. 
    

2) In E. coli, cinnamaldehyde can be synthesized from intracellular l-phenylalanine, which requires the activities of three enzymes: phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR).
    the specific molecule cinnamaldehyde, which is present in cinnamon bark oil, is attractive as a pesticide because of its potent nematicidal activity. [12, 13] 
    Nematicides are chemical pesticides which have several disadvantages: (i) it is necessary to pay attention to the chemical pesticide used in many susceptible plants and crops, (ii) non-selectivity of the pesticide may cause elimination of other organisms  and (iii) if the pathogen remains after treatment, the damage may be severely exacerbated [8, 9]
    
    In this study, we engineered E.Coli for the production of cinnamaldehyde. Three biosynthetic enzymes, PAL, 4CL and CCR were cloned into E.Coli. We also manipulated metabolic pathways in E.Coli to increase the intracellular pool of l-phenylalanine.
